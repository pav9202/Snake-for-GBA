Snake-for-GBA
=============

This is a snake game made in C for the Game Boy Advanced using the Tonc framework. However, it uses no wrapper libraries from Tonc, simply the coding guidlines. All memory access is direct and all images are displayed using DMA to the memory buffers of the Game Boy Advanced. 

This game uses lives as opposed to simply loosing. A score of 10 wins, and a loss of 3 lives loses.
